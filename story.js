Your next stop, Hobbiton, The Shire, Bag End. It was just at this time that Gandalf reappeared after his long absence. For three years he had been away. It was a brief visit, and after taking a good look at you he went off again.",
    "During the next year or two he had turned up fairly often, coming unexpectedly after dusk, and going off without warning before sunrise. He would not discuss his own business and journeys, and seemed chiefly interested in small news about your health and doings.",

He brought forth news of evil tidings and has urged you to begin preparations for a journey to deliver the Ring to Rivendell. He shall come back immediately, or at least send word. In the meanwhile, stick to your plan and don’t use the ring! He went off at dawn. “I may be back any day,” he said. “At the very latest I shall come back for the farewell party.

Seven months have passed, and then on a day like any other, shadowy hooded figures clad in black have sought you out. They took the Ring and left you for dead. With Sauron back to his full strength, the Age of the Free Peoples of Middle-Earth came to an end.",

    "The sound of hooves stops. As you watch, something dark passes across the lighter space between two trees, and then halts. It looks like the black shade of a horse led by a smaller black shadow. The black shadow stands close to the point where they had left the path, and it sways from side to side. You think you hear the sound of snuffling. The shadow bends to the ground, and then begins to crawl towards you.",
    "A desire to slip on the Ring comes over you, but this time it is stronger than ever before. So strong that, almost before you realize, your hand is in your pocket. But at that moment, there comes a sound like mingled song and laughter. Clear voices rise and fall in the starlit air. The black shadow straightens up and retreats. It climbs onto the shadowy horse and seems to vanish across the lane into the darkness on the other side. You breathe again.",

The tidings are mostly sad and ominous: of gathering darkness, the wars of Men, and the flight of the Elves. The Elves make a promise to spread word of your journey amongst The Wandering Companies and those that have power for good shall be on the watch. You are named Elf-friend!",

You sit down and scratch your head and yawn like a cavern. You are worried, the afternoon is getting late and you think this sudden sleepiness is uncanny. You wonder what sort of dreams your companions are having. As you turn to look at them, you discover that your companions are trapped by the roots of the tree, almost completely enclosed. Those of your company struggle to free themselves, but their efforts are fruitless.",

You feel desperate: lost and witless. Suddenly you stop. There is an answer, or so you think; but it seems to come from behind you, away down the path further back in the Forest. You turn round and listen, and soon there can be no doubt: someone is singing a song; a deep glad voice is singing carelessly and happily, but it is singing nonsense:",

It is answered; out from the trees and rocks away on the left, four other Riders come flying. Two ride towards you; two gallop madly towards the Ford to cut off your escape. They seem to you to run like the wind and to grow swiftly larger and darker, as their courses converge with yours.",

Not with the hope of escape, or of doing anything, either good or bad: you simply feel that you must put it on. You shut your eyes and struggle for a while; but resistance becomes unbearable, and at last you slowly draw out the chain, and slip the Ring onto the forefinger of your left hand.",

You slide on the Ring, seeking power and splendour, but find yourself overpowered by it.",
